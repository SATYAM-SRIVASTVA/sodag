          <h2>What Is Gas And Bloating?</h2>
          <p>
            Gas in your stomach and digestive system is part of the normal
            process of digestion. Getting rid of excess gas, either by burping
            or passing gas (flatus), is also normal. Stomach pain due to gas may
            occur if gas is trapped or not moving well through your digestive
            system.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bloating is a sensation of having a full stomach, often due to a gas
            problem.1,2 Most of us have experienced the bloated stomach, when
            the tummy is stretched, puffy and uncomfortable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eating a lot of salty food and carbohydrates can make you feel
            bloated, as can eating too fast or drinking a lot of fizzy drinks.
          </p>

          <h2>Causes & Symptoms</h2>
          <p>
            One common cause of bloating/gas is constipation.2 The longer your
            stool sits in your colon, the more time bacteria have to ferment
            what’s there which makes you feel bloated.2
          </p>
          <li>
            Eating habits: Eating too much too quickly in one sitting can
            trigger acidity and gas both5, as it may cause a person to swallow
            more air, resulting in gas formation immediately after eating.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diet: Consumption of food like whole wheat, beans and lentils,
            cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower, corn, potatoes, carbonated beverages
            or milk and dairy products can also contribute to gas.
          </li>
          <li>
            Medical conditions: Like chronic intestinal disease, change in
            bacteria in small intestine, food intolerances or constipation could
            also contribute to intestinal gas, bloating or gas pain
          </li>

          <h2>Prevention & Relief</h2>

          <p>
            Dietary changes may help reduce the amount of gas your body
            produces. Keeping a diary of your diet and gas symptoms will help
            your doctor and you to determine the best options for changes in
            your diet. The following lifestyle tips may improve gas symptoms:
          </p>

          <li>
            Prevent overeating: Overeating leads to indigestion, sluggishness
            and an uncomfortable gassy bloating
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid spicy and fried food: It can trigger bloating as these are
            heavy and difficult to digest, causing excess gas in the stomach.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Adding fiber to the diet: It helps ensure better digestion that can
            reduce the episodes of bloating. Including dry fruits, nuts, grains,
            fruits, vegetables and legumes to your diet can/may ensure better
            digestion by increasing your fiber intake.
          </li>
          <li>
            Exercise regularly: Little or no exercise can cause bloating as the
            body becomes sluggish and lazy. Maintaining a healthy exercise
            routine aids in better digestion and controls bloating.{" "}
          </li>
          <li>
            Have water: To help prevent constipation, drink water throughout the
            day and with fiber supplements.
          </li>
          <li>
            Restrict alcohol, caffeine and cigarettes: Try keeping a check on
            the amount of tea, coffee, cigarettes and alcohol you consume, as
            all these are triggers for bloating.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce dairy: You also may try dairy products that are lactose-free
            or take milk products supplemented with lactase to help with
            digestion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sugar substitutes: Eliminate or reduce sugar substitutes, or try a
            different substitute.
          </li>
          <li>
            Carbonated beverages: Avoid or reduce your intake of carbonated
            beverages.
          </li>
