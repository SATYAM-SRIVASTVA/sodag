          <h2>Understanding The Types Of Acidity Problems And Its Remedies</h2>
          <h3>
            <strong>
              You’ve probably heard people talk about acid reflux, gastric
              reflux or just plain reflux, as well as GERD, gastro-esophageal
              reflux and heartburn. These are all problems with acidity, and
              it’s estimated they affect up to 25% of adults at some time of
              their life.1
            </strong>
          </h3>
          <p>
            We all need stomach acid (gastric acid) to help us digest our food,
            but sometimes it ends up causing problems like the ones listed
            above. All these terms can be a bit confusing – are they different
            names for the same thing, or are they different things?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you have acidity problems, we can help you work out what’s going
            on and how to get relief. But before we do, it’s worth pointing out
            that if your symptoms are severe or prolonged, you should see your
            doctor.

          <h2>What Type Of Acidity Problem Do You Have?</h2>
          <p>
            To get to know more about acid reflux and gastro-esophageal reflux
            disease (GERD), it helps to understand a little bit about stomach
            acid.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our bodies produce stomach acid to help us digest our food.
            Generally, when our stomach acid stays in our stomach there aren’t
            any problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have a special ring of muscle at the entrance to the stomach,
            called the ‘lower esophogeal sphincter’(LES), to help us keep our
            stomach acid where it belongs.1,2 The LES relaxes to allow food and
            drink to enter our stomach, and then tightens again to keep it
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes though, the LES relaxes when we don’t want it to, allowing
            stomach acid to escape back up the esophagus. This is when we get
            ‘acidity problems’ like acid reflux, heartburn and GERD.

            <p>
              If acid from the stomach comes right up the oesophagus to the
              throat or mouth, this is called acid reflux. Around 16% of the
              population in Western countries is affected by acid reflux

              Heartburn tends to occur when stomach acid or acidic gases are
              lower down the esophagus.1 In Western countries, approximately 23%
              of the population is affected by heartburn.

              in the esophagus. GERD affects around 20% of people in the West
              and between 3% and 16% of people in Asia

            <p>
              Please remember that chest pain can be a symptom of a heart

              in the arm or jaw. If you have these symptoms it’s important to

            Whether you have acid reflux, heartburn or GERD, you’ll be happy to
            know that there are a number of
            <br />
            things you can do to stop or reduce the symptoms and help prevent
            them from occurring again.

          <p>
            Most doctors recommend trying some changes to your lifestyle as the
            first step.1-4 It’s generally best to
            <br /> try a couple of changes at a time so you can see which ones
            work and which ones don’t.

            You might already have a good idea of something that might trigger

            <h2>TREATMENTS LIKE ANTACIDS CAN ALSO HELP</h2>
          </div>
          <p>
            As well as making some changes to your lifestyle, medications can be
            very helpful to manage the
            <br /> symptoms of acid reflux, heartburn or GERD.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are three main types of medications to treat acidity symptoms:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="gred-seventh-span"> Antacids</span> – like Eno,
            these work by neutralising the acid in your stomach (gastric acid).
            It’s usually
            <br /> recommended to try an antacid before other medications
            because they’re readily available from
            <br />
            pharmacies and they tend to provide relief very quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span className="gred-seventh-span">
              {" "}
              H2-receptor antagonists (H2RAs)
            </span>
            – These are designed to reduce the amount of gastric acid you
            <br /> produce. They don’t work as quickly as antacids, but the
            effects may last longer.
          </p>
          
          <p>
            <span className="gred-seventh-span">
              {" "}
              Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs){" "}
            </span>
            – These work in a similar way to H2RAs, but they are more powerful
            and
            <br /> therefore may be more effective if your symptoms are more
            severe.
          </p>
