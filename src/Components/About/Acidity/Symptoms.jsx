          <h2>A Little Acidity Is Still Too Much</h2>
          <p>
            For you, day-to-day life involves caring for, and being there for
            your family and loved ones. It involves
            <br /> being productive at work with your colleagues and boss. But
            we understand that being 100% doesn’t just
            <br /> mean balancing family and work – you want that something
            extra, that little bit more for yourself. We
            <br /> also know that acidity, from the moment of its onset, can and
            will distract you from being your 100%.
            <br /> That’s why we’ve put together tips on how you may control
            mild acidity, so that you can get back to being
            <br />
            your best self at all times.

          <h2>How Do You Know If You Are Experiencing The Onset Of Acidity?</h2>
          <p>
            About of acidity typically begins with mild and short-lived
            symptoms. The most common symptoms are occasional reflux and a
            burning sensation or discomfort in the middle of the chest, known as
            heartburn.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should you experience these symptoms, it will be good to keep track
            of their occurrences or any triggers and manage them accordingly in
            case they get worse. It is also always a good idea to consult your
            doctor if you are unsure.

          Other Tips To Help Control Acidity

          <div className="last-para-symptoms">
          <p>Simple changes to diet and lifestyle might be able to help you get 
              acidity under control. However, these do not guarantee prevention and 
              there might still be times when you still experience mild acidity. In that
               case, what can you do about it?</p>
          <p>Many doctors will recommend trying an antacid if diet and lifestyle 
              changes aren’t enough. Antacids work by neutralising the acid in your
               stomach and they tend to provide relief very quickly.</p>
          <p>There are quite a few different antacids that you can use in case a remedy
               is required. For mild or early symptoms of acidity, it’s best to choose
                an antacid that is gentle on you but tough on acidity.</p>
          <p>However if you are considering an antacid, and are pregnant or breastfeeding,
               take other medicines or have any chronic illnesses, please consult your doctor.</p>
          <p>You can learn more about managing acidity with a busy lifestyle here.</p>
          <p>Of course, please see your doctor if an antacid isn’t enough to control your
               symptoms or if your symptoms worry you. </p>
