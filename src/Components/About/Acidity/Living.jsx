                A life without acidity problems – that’s the dream!
                Unfortunately, the reality is
                <br /> that many of us have to deal with the nightmare of
                acidity at some point.1 But
                <br /> not to worry. Whether you’re at home, at work, at school,
                or even traveling,
                <br /> here are a few tips on how to control acidity as you go
                about your everyday

            </div>
            <p>
              If you struggle with acidity, you are not alone. A staggering 25%
              of adults have acidity problems.1 At
              <br /> certain situations or places, symptoms like heartburn and
              acid reflux could be worse. For example, you
              <br /> might have experienced a bad heartburn during a
              particularly stressful day at work or even during
              <br /> bedtime at home.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you lead a life with acidity, don’t worry, no matter where and
              when it strikes, there are simple things you can do to get relief.
              We’ve put together some great suggestions to help you control
              heartburn and acid reflux – and get back to enjoying life.

            <h2>How To Control Acidity At Home</h2>
            <p>
              While acidity symptoms can occur at any time, around 70% to 75% of
              people who have acidity problems say that they have heartburn at
              night.
            </p>
            <p>
              For most of us, the few hours after having dinner at night are
              precious – it’s one of the few times you get to relax and have
              time with your family or to yourself. So if you get heartburn and
              other symptoms of acidity, like reflux, it can be a real drag.
            </p>
            <p>
              Many people also find heartburn disturbs their sleep,3,4 which can
              have a big impact on their mood and productivity during the day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first thing to try if you have heartburn at night is to make a
              few changes to your diet and lifestyle. Here are a few handy tips
              that have been shown to help.

                <p>
                  When you eat soon before going to bed, you’ll have a full
                  stomach. This not only stimulates acid production, it may
                  stretch and weaken the ring of muscle that holds the esophagus
                  shut. You should also try to cut down on spicy or rich foods.

                <p>
                  Lying flat on your back makes it more likely for acid or
                  acidic gas to rise up from your stomach. Raising the head of
                  your bed by putting some blocks of wood or wedges of dense
                  foam under the legs can help combat this.

                  People often ask which side is best to sleep on to reduce
                  heartburn. The answer is the left! The entrance to the stomach
                  is towards the right side, so if you lie on that side there’s
                  more chance acid could leak out.

                  After a long day at work, or school, home is where you deserve
                  to be at peace, and the last thing one’d expect to come
                  knocking is acidity. But with Eno, let acidity out the door in
                  less than 6 seconds*. As the old saying goes, ‘Eno on, Acidity
                  gone’

            <p>
              Unless you’ve won the lottery, you probably have to work for a
              living! While that’s fine – and work can even be very fulfilling –
              getting heartburn or acid reflux at work can really dampen your
              mood.
            </p>
            <p>
              Like many people, you may find that stress, or a lack of sleep,
              can trigger your acidity symptoms or make them worse. Not eating
              well is another common cause of problems – let’s face it,
              sometimes we’re just too busy to have a proper break at lunchtime
              and eat something healthy, or we’re tempted by sweet snacks during
              the day.

              Here are four simple ways to help avoid acidity symptoms at work.

                <p>
                  We have all had that disturbing memory when the whole class
                  goes silent a moment before your stomach starts grumbling.
                  Maybe you had too much coffee in the break, or probably the
                  canteen samosas betrayed you. Now you have the whole class
                  looking at you. Save yourself from the embarrassment, with
                  Eno. Eno complements your body’s natural defence mechanism to
                  fight acid indigestion, and gets to work in 6 seconds*.

            <h2>How To Control Acidity When Traveling</h2>
            <p>
              There’s nothing like travel to stimulate the senses and
              reinvigorate the soul. It’s no wonder it’s one of the most popular
              things people do, no matter where they live around the world.
            </p>
            <p>
              Unfortunately though, travel can have a downside. Moving into
              different time zones, disrupting your usual routines and eating
              different foods can all lead to digestive upsets, including
              heartburn and acid reflux.
            </p>
            <p>
              With a little planning and by following these tips, you can
              minimise the chances of having acidity problems ruin your
              travelling experience.

                    <h2>Do Your Research</h2>
                    <p>
                      While you’re planning your itinerary, find out about the
                      local cuisine too. Trying different foods is part of the
                      travel experience, but if there are ones that you know
                      contain ingredients that will trigger acidity, such as
                      onions, garlic or tomatoes, it’s best to avoid them.

                    <p>
                      When you’re out and about, grabbing some fast food or
                      buying a pre-packaged snack is certainly convenient… but
                      these foods are often high in fats or fried, which can
                      cause acidity.1 Look for healthier alternatives, like
                      salads, fresh sandwiches, fresh and dried fruits
                      (non-citrus) and granola bars, or bring them with you.

                      If you’re out sightseeing or enjoying the local culture,
                      you can find yourself eating later than you would
                      normally. Going to bed with a full stomach can lead to
                      heartburn and acid reflux, so avoid this if you can.

                      If you’re out having a good time, one or two drinks can
                      easily turn into three or four (or even more!). Alcohol
                      has been shown to affect acidity in a number of ways, so

                      Even though travel is usually fun, you can sometimes find
                      yourself in stressful situations. You might miss a
                      transport connection or find the hotel you booked isn’t up
                      to scratch. Stress can contribute to acidity problems,1,2
                      so try and stay calm and keep your problems in
                      perspective.

            <h2>What Else Can Help Control Acidity?</h2>
            <p>
              If our lifestyle tips aren’t enough to help you avoid acidity
              symptoms, you may get relief from an antacid. Antacids are
              generally good to try before other treatments because they’re
              readily available from pharmacies and easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
              Antacids, like Eno, work by neutralising the acid in your stomach
              (gastric acid) and they tend to provide relief very quickly.
