              Imagine This – Acidity Strikes At The Most Inconvenient Time And
              All You Have At Hand Is Tea, Milk Or Some Other Home Remedy You’ve
              Heard About Before. What Do You Do?
            </p>
            <p>
              We’ve all been there. After a particularly satisfying meal,
              symptoms of acidity – such as a burning sensation in the chest –
              appear1 and all we really want is for the discomfort to resolve
              fast.1 But when the closest pharmacy is more than a few minutes
              away, it might be tempting to rely on home remedies that we
              vaguely remember reading about instead.
            </p>
            <p>
              It’s actually quite hard to know which home remedies could help
              alleviate your symptoms and which ones might be doing more harm
              than good. There are a lot of claims and promises made, so we’ve
              tried to sift through some of the evidence for you.

            </h2>
            <p>
              When it comes to home remedies for acidity, scientists have
              conducted studies to determine how effective common food and
              beverages are in helping with symptoms.2 Here are some of the
              findings on the most commonly suggested food and beverage
              remedies.

                  <h2>Does Milk Help Relieve Heartburn?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Short answer – no. A glass of milk may seem like a good idea
                    after a meal but think twice. While milk may temporarily
                    buffer stomach acid, it may also cause acidity to worsen.2
                    In fact, certain nutrients in milk such as fat may stimulate
                    the stomach to produce more acid.2 In addition to this,
                    overfilling the stomach with milk may increase acidity
                    symptoms.

                  <h2>Does Tea Help Relieve Heartburn?</h2>
                  <p>
                    Generally, no. Tea is consumed by two thirds of the people
                    in the world.3 However, it may actually cause acidity to
                    worsen.3 Tea is associated with acidity because it may
                    increase gastric acid secretion.3 However, it may contribute
                    to acidity through other ways too.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Peppermint tea, for example, was identified as a risk factor
                    for developing acidity symptoms.4 This may be due to the
                    fact that peppermint may cause the muscles that prevent
                    stomach acid from rising up into the esophagus to relax.4
                    Green tea was also found to be a risk factor in the
                    development of chronic acidity or gastro-esophageal reflux
                    disease (GERD).

                  <h2>Does Chewing Gum Help Relieve Heartburn?</h2>
                  <p>
                    It depends. While we’ve established earlier how peppermint
                    may not be a good idea to have after a meal, chewing gum
                    free of peppermint or sugar may be a good acidity remedy.2,6
                    Chewing gum for half an hour after a meal can prevent
                    stomach acid from rising up into the esophagus.2,6 This is
                    because the act of chewing gum makes you swallow more often
                    and produce more saliva – an acid buffer.

                    Herbal remedies have been used successfully for thousands of
                    years in Ayurvedic and other non-Western medicines. Based on
                    this, some studies have been done on herbs commonly used to
                    treat indigestion, such as caraway, cumin, fennel, ajwain,
                    German chamomile and lemon balm.2,7-9 All of these have some
                    beneficial effects on digestion,2,7-9 which could in turn
                    reduce acidity symptoms.

                    If you do try herbal remedies and you take any other
                    medicines you should tell your pharmacist or doctor, as some
                    herbal remedies and some medicines may interact.

                    When we know we’re about to have a big meal, we might be
                    inclined to stay away from more figure-hugging outfits – and
                    for good reason. Tight-fitting clothing can put additional

                    the esophagus and contributing to acidity.16 Try wearing
                    loose clothing and avoiding outfits that fit tightly around
                    the mid-abdomen to help relieve occasional symptoms.

                    It might be tempting to take a quick nap after a good meal.
                    But before you jump into bed, take some time to think if
                    it’s a good idea. Two to three hours is the amount of time
                    recommended to stay in an upright position after eating to
                    prevent stomach acid from rising up into the
                    esophagus.2,16,18 That’s why it’s best to eat early in the
                    evening so the meal is digested by bedtime.

                    enjoyed in moderation. Larger meals will empty slowly from
                    the stomach and put pressure on the muscle that keeps acid
                    from rising up into the esophagus.18 This can cause symptoms
                    of acidity.2,16,18 It might be good to try having small
                    frequent meals instead.2,16,18 In fact, a light meal is

                    recommended to help prevent further episodes of

                    prevents stomach acid from rising up into your esophagus.11
                    Drinking alcohol compromises the same muscle, stimulates
                    acid production and makes the esophagus more sensitive to
