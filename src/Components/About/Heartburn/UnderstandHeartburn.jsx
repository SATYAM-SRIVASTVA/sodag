            Heartburn problems affect up to 20% or more of adults on a regular basis.1,2 So even though you might think other people won’t understand what you’re going through, you’re not alone.

            <p>
              The most common problems associated with acidity are heartburn and
              acid reflux.1,2 Heartburn is that
              <br /> uncomfortable, burning feeling you have in the centre of
              your chest, especially after eating a large meal.
              <br />
              <br /> Acid reflux occurs when you taste regurgitated food or
              sour, bitter liquid at the back of your mouth or
              <br /> throat.
            </p>
            <p>
            Heartburn symptoms can be very unpleasant and can strike at the most inconvenient of times, but they can usually be managed quickly and simply.

            <h2>What Is Heartburn?</h2>
            <p>
            To understand what heartburn is, let’s revisit what we learned in science class about the digestive system.
            </p>
            <p>
              When we swallow food or drink, it travels down a ‘pipe’ – called
              the esophagus – to our stomach. The
              <br /> base of the esophagus, where it joins the stomach, has a
              band of muscle around it called a<br /> sphincter.1 This sphincter
              is closed tightly most of the time. It opens to allow food to
              enter the
              <br /> stomach, and then closes to stop the stomach contents from
              escaping.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the sphincter at the base of the esophagus is weakened or
              relaxes when it’s not meant to, gastric
              <br /> acid can rise up into the esophagus and it’s this acid that
              causes the uncomfortable symptom,
              <br /> heartburn

            <h2>Causes And Risks For Heartburn Problems</h2>
            <p>
              While a weak or abnormally relaxed oesophageal sphincter is the
              main cause of heartburn, we don’t
              <br /> always know why it becomes weakened or relaxed
            </p>
            <p>
              When we eat a large meal, our sphincter muscles could stretch or
              become weakened. Similarly, bending
              <br /> over or lying down may increase the pressure on the
              sphincter, causing it to relax.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other things seem to increase the risk of acidity problems without
              necessarily affecting the sphincter
              <br /> itself, so it’s a good idea to avoid them.

                    <strong>Do Certain Foods And Drinks Cause Heartburn?</strong>
                  </h3>
                  <p>Yes, they do.</p>
                  <p>
                    We all have the occasional craving for certain foods that
                    aren’t very good for us.
                    <br /> But it’s important to remember to take everything in
                    moderation. Fatty or fried foods,
                    <br /> spicy foods, onions and garlic, tomatoes and
                    <br /> tomato products, citrus fruits and chocolate may
                    trigger acidity problems or make them worse.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Just like with food, it’s important to be wise about our
                    choice of beverage – especially
                    <br /> after a meal. Alcohol, coffee, tea and other
                    softdrinks or energy drinks that contain
                    <br /> caffeine may also trigger acidity problems or make
                    them worse.

                  <p>
                    Several of our lifestyle choices may be triggering

                  <p>
                    Smoking may weaken the oesophageal sphincter. Besides being
                    bad for our lungs,
                    <br /> cigarettes bring about a host of other problems. This
                    includes problems in the GI system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Another factor that has a strong association with having
                    acidity problems is being
                    <br /> overweight. Losing weight doesn’t only have to be for
                    aesthetic purposes. It could
                    <br /> also improve your general health and wellbeing.

                  <p>
                    Also, many people find stress, or a lack of sleep can
                    trigger their acidity symptoms or make them worse.

            <p>
              Most of us have experienced heartburn – that burning sensation in
              the chest – at
              <br /> some point in our lives. This is because it is the most
              common symptom
              <br /> of an acidity problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              Quite a lot of people suffer from heartburn at night, and around
              three out of every
              <br /> four of these people say it disrupts their sleep.3 Acidity
              problems at night may be
              <br /> related to lifestyle factors – you can learn more about
              that here.
            </p>
            <p>
              Heartburn also commonly occurs during pregnancy. In fact, it is
              often seen as a<br /> completely normal part of being pregnant.4

              If you experience severe or very frequent heartburn (2 or more
              times a week) and
              <br /> often have acid reflux, make an appointment with your
              doctor as this may indicate a<br /> more serious form of acidity,
              called gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD).
